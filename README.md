# Fake-News-classification-using-NLP-with-LSTM-neural-network
## This is a project developed to "Natural Language Processing" course of Data-Science Technology college.
This project aims to classify classify news as true or false the. A LSTM-type recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained to automatically classify the news provided as true or fake.
The algorithm was written in Python, using the Pandas library to read and organize the data. The keras, sklearn, numpy, pandas, nltk and a few other libraries were used in creating and training the model.  
Dataset that was used in this project: https://github.com/roneysco/Fake.br-Corpus
